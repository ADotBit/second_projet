This was the second project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page">Odin</a>.
I did it on the 10 August 2022, i've just learnt how to use Flex at this moment and it was disappointing. I didn't really knew how to use Flexbox but still, i went to end of the project and i was proud.
I used my dogs to do it. The display of the elements is far from perfect but the satisfaction was there.
